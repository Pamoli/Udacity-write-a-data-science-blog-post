# Udacity-write-a-data-science-blog-post
In this project, using Python and its libraries, we will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it, analyze it and and write a blog post about the insights <br/>
The dataset that we will be wrangling and analyzing is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.
The technical aspects as in all the codes and datasets would be available in this github repo.

# Data sources:
This dataset has three parts.<br/>
1. The WeRateDogs Twitter archive data. This data was given to us by Udacity.
2. The tweet image predictions, i.e., what breed of dog (or other object, animal, etc.) is present in each tweet according to a neural network. This is hosted on Udacity servers and needed to be downloaded programmatically.
3. Some additional data on the dogs. We got this data by querying the Twitter API for each tweet's JSON data using Python's Tweepy library.

# Tools used:
